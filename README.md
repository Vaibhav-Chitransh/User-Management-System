# User Management System

## Project Overview

The User Management System is a web-based application designed to manage user roles and permissions through a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI. This project provides a user-friendly interface for administrators to manage users, assign roles, and control access to various functionalities within the application.

### Features

- *User  Registration*: Allows new users to register and create an account.
- *User  Login*: Secure login functionality for registered users.
- *Role Management*: Admins can create, update, and delete roles within the system.
- *Permission Management*: Assign specific permissions to roles, controlling access to various features.
- *User  Management*: Admins can view, edit, and delete user accounts.
- *Dashboard*: An overview of user statistics and role distributions.

### My Role
